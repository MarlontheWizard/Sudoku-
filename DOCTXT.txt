Difficulty
Game difficulty will range from 1-9. In Sudoku, game difficulty
seems to be proportional to the number of values already filled in.
An easy difficulty will rely on giving the player a nearly filled board 
and vice versa for harder difficulties. Of course, the player will choose
their level of difficulty. The motivation for using values 1-9 is derived 
from its divisability with the total number of squares, 81. If x is the 
inputted difficulty, level one could hypothetically consist a lower bound of 
81/x and an upper bound of (81/x) - 5 values given. Generating a random value 
within these restrictions will make the filled values dynamic.
